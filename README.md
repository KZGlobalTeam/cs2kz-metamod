Requirements: Metamod plugin

Compilation:
- Remember to *recursively* clone the plugin!
- For each platform:
  
Windows (VS): 
```
mkdir build
cd build
py ../configure.py --hl2sdk-root "../" --gen=vs --vs-version 17
``` 

Linux (ambuild/clang):
```
mkdir build
cd build
py ../configure.py --hl2sdk-root "../"
ambuild
``` 

Note: does not work with gcc!

Linux (Docker w/ Valve's Docker SDK Image):
```
docker build -t cs2kz_metamod_build .
docker create --name cs2kz_metamod_build cs2kz_metamod_build
docker cp cs2kz_metamod_build:/cs2kz_metamod/build/package .
docker rm cs2kz_metamod_build
```

Copy the contents of `package/` to your server's `csgo/` directory.
