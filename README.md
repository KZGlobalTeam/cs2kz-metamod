Requirements: Metamod plugin

Compilation:
- Remember to *recursively* clone the plugin!
- For each platform:
  
Windows (VS): 
```
mkdir build
cd build
py ../configure.py --hl2sdk-root "../" --gen=vs --vs-version 17
``` 

Linux (ambuild/clang):
```
mkdir build
cd build
py ../configure.py --hl2sdk-root "../"
ambuild
``` 

Note: does not work with gcc!

Linux (Docker w/ Valve SDK Image):
```
mkdir build
docker build -t cs2kz-linux-builder .
docker run --rm -v ./build:/app/build cs2kz-linux-builder
```

Copy the contents of `build/package/` to your server's `csgo/` directory.
